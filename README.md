# QuickNotes
QuickNotes is a small open-source note-taking application written in C#. It is currently in an early build, and has no UI. My planned features are going to be:


  **PLANNED FEATURES:**
   
   1. Ability to make notes like Microsoft word, no paid subscription.
   2. **Bold**, _Italic_ and Underlined text.
   3. Clean and simple UI
   4. Ability to edit existing text files and save them as new ones.
   
   These might change as development goes on, I will change the README.md as (if) they do.
   
   
   
   
   
   This project is made entirely by me.
   If you wish to follow the project, hit the "Follow" button. It would help me out a lot.
   
   :D
